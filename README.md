A kind of copy of www.coinmarketcap.com using React and Redux. It uses their API to list all the information on the homepage.

To see a chart, only Bitcoin is currently available. This is because there is no API for the time data from coinmarketcap and the resource is directly on the server instance. However, if you click "Bitcoin" on the homepage, you can at least see the data, which is implemented using HighCharts.

See it in action here (might have some start up time if not accessed in a while): https://serene-tor-49154.herokuapp.com/
